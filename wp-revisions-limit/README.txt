== Description ==

Keep your WordPress **fast** and your database **clean**!

WordPress 3.6 allows users to control how many revisions are stored for each supported post type.
This plugin provides an interface for this new functionality.

= Why you should use this plugin? =

Each time you click **Save Draft** or **Update**, a revision is saved on the database.
WordPress will store all revisions for each page on your blog. Revisions allow you to look back at the recent changes you’ve made and revert to an earlier version if necessary.

But, what about all those revisions that you won't use anymore? Yes, they are still there, taking space from your hosting space and increasing the volume of your database and making it slower and heavier!

With this plugin you can easily limit the number of revisions that you want to save, with this you are saving space on your database and keeping the overall site performance in good shape.

Once `WP Revisions Limit` plugin is installed and activated, go to **Settings >  Revisions Limit** in your WordPress site and specify the number of revisions you want to store for each post/page under **Revisions Options** section.


= Compatibility: =
